# n8n Self-Hosting with Ngrok

## Introduction

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a powerful workflow automation tool that allows you to connect various services and automate tasks. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to expose an existing n8n self-hosted instance to the internet securely with Ngrok.

## What is ngrok?

Ngrok is a tool that creates secure tunnels to your localhost, allowing you to expose local web servers behind NATs and firewalls to the internet.


## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
- An existing n8n self-hosted instance running via Docker

## Step 1: Expose n8n to the Internet Using Ngrok

1. Start Ngrok and expose port 5678:
   ```sh
   ngrok http http://localhost:5678
   ```

2. Ngrok will provide a forwarding URL (e.g., `https://randomsub.ngrok.io`). Copy this URL.

4. Stop the running n8n container:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```
5. Update your n8n environment variables to include the Ngrok URL:
   ```sh
   WEBHOOK_URL=https://20b3-197-211-58-214.ngrok-free.app
   ```
6. Restart n8n with the updated configuration:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Step 2: Access n8n

1. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5678`
2. Log in with your existing credentials.
3. To use webhooks in workflows, ensure that external services send requests to the Ngrok URL (`https://20b3-197-211-58-214.ngrok-free.app`).

## Step 3: Set Up a Static Domain (Free Plan)

Ngrok now allows the use of static domains even on the free plan. This provides a persistent URL that doesn't change every time you restart the tunnel.

## Steps to Get a Static Domain:

1. Go to your ngrok dashboard.
2. Navigate to the Deploy your app online section.
3. Under the Static Domain tab, copy the provided URL and command.

4. Replace the static url with the temporary url provided to you earlier in the environment variables
   ```sh
   WEBHOOK_URL=https://lark-striking-wholly.ngrok-free.app
   ```
6. Run the command in your terminal.
   ```sh
   ngrok http --url=lark-striking-wholly.ngrok-free.app 5678
   ```
Now, you have a permanent/static link that will remain the same as long as you use this command.

## Troubleshooting

- If n8n doesnâ€™t start correctly, check the logs:
  ```sh
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```
- Ensure your Ngrok session is running; otherwise, restart it and update the `WEBHOOK_URL`.

## Conclusion

You have successfully exposed your self-hosted n8n instance to the internet securely using Ngrok. This setup enables you to develop and test workflows that require external webhook connections.
